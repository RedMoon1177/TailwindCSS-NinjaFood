Using Live-server (development server) to run the website in this project:

1. Install live-server globally
   To install it globally, run: npm install -g live-server
   This will make the live-server command available globally on your machine: **live-server public**

2. Run live-server locally (without global installation)
   Alternatively, you can run live-server from the locally installed node module by using npx: **npx live-server public**
